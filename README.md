# Biomass Gasification ‚Äì Machine Learning Modeling

This project aims to build and compare three machine learning (ML) models ‚Äî **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**, **Random Forest (RF)**, and **Support Vector Machines (SVM)** ‚Äî to predict the composition of syngas produced from biomass gasification. The study is based on the thesis:

**Pimentel, Fernanda.** *Development of Predictive Models for Biomass Gasification Using Artificial Neural Networks*. May 26, 2022, p. 134.

In addition to model development, this project includes an exploratory analysis and the use of the **SMOGN** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for Regression with Gaussian Noise) technique to address data imbalance. Performance comparisons were made across models using key regression metrics.
